<p> What is National Blood Ceneter ? </p>

<p>An organisation with primary focus on bringing voluntary blood donors closer to those who need them. The idea is to facilitate a requestor to approach a donor in his/her required location and time.</p>

<p> We are also trying to provide as many resources as we can for rural child education. Anyone who believes in our principles and has desire to serve humanity are welcome to join us as everyone's friends. </p>

<p> Who are these friends ? </p>
<p> A friend is one of us, in us. "A friend is somoeone who is there for you when he'd rather be somewhere else" - Unknown </p>

<p> So what are we(National Blood Ceneter) planning to do with this website ? </p>
<p> Through this website, we are bridging the gap between blood donors and requestors. We display the donor details of those registered with us, to be useful for people who are searching for blood donors. We also support child education and helpless people by providing them as many resources as we can.</p>

<p> How does friends2support find helpless people ? </p>

<p> Currently, we are supporting the people whose information was provided to National Blood Ceneter by one of our volunteers. If you are willing to join us, then provide us the information, so that we can get together and create an idea to support those who need us.</p>
